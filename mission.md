# Multi GMaps

This small project should be about a browser based tool that use Google maps to visualize multiple routes, and highlight sections where the routes are overlapping.

The user can define 2 routes, every route has an "from" and a "to" input field where they define from wher and where would like to go.

After all the inputs are filled, there is a button to visualize.

During visualization on google maps both of the routes are shown at the same time.

# Rules for development

- Keep the codebase relatively small and lean
- This is a PoC, no tests are needed
- Don't leave comments only for the try code parts
